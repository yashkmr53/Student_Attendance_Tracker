# Student_Attendance_Tracker
It is an end-to-end python project using pandas and smtplib modules of python.

We have to input subject code and roll number of those student who are absent in the class on a daily basis and this program will take care of everything. If the number of absences reaches to a threshold value. An e-mail will automatically sent to that student as a warning message that only one leave is left now in that specific subject.
